# üë®‚Äçüíª Piyush Sharma 


Welcome to my project showcase! I'm a computer science enthusiast who enjoys solving real-world problems through code. Below you'll find a few projects I've built using Python, Django, and Pygame. Each of them reflects my passion for building meaningful solutions and improving my skills through hands-on experience.

## üìù Django To-Do List App

A simple yet functional web application built using the Django framework. It allows users to:

- Add, update, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Maintain a persistent list with user-friendly UI

**Technologies used:** Django, HTML, CSS, SQLite  
**Focus areas:** Backend logic, MVC architecture, and CRUD operations

> This project helped me understand how web frameworks work and how to build solutions that people can use to stay organized.

## üêç Snake Game (Pygame)

A classic snake game built with Pygame where the snake moves, grows when it eats food, and the game ends when it hits the wall or itself.

**Features:**

- Real-time movement and key control
- Dynamic scoring system
- Clean UI with a retro feel

**Technologies used:** Python, Pygame  
**Focus areas:** Game loop logic, collision detection, and event handling

> I built this game to learn how real-time systems work and how to design game logic from scratch.

## ‚ùå‚≠ï Criss Cross (Tic-Tac-Toe in Pygame)

A two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with a graphical interface. The game determines the winner or a draw automatically after each move.

**Features:**

- Interactive grid UI using Pygame
- Simple yet efficient game logic
- Replayable with clear winner messages

**Technologies used:** Python, Pygame  
**Focus areas:** Grid-based logic, UI rendering, state management

## üí° About Me

I'm deeply interested in **problem solving**, especially when it involves **developing software that adds real value**. I find joy in building solutions that are not just functional but helpful‚Äîwhether it's making someone‚Äôs day more productive with a to-do list or creating games that teach and entertain.

I'm always looking for opportunities to:

- Solve algorithmic problems (e.g., LeetCode, Codeforces)
- Build tools or applications that address real human needs
- Learn new technologies that improve how I think and build
